## My process

- I started with the HTML structure, and ended up using CSS on what I had done. It wasn't easy at first because I couldn't find a way how to set my QR Code card verticaly.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- FLEX

### What I learned

I have learned how to set position a card and a box vertically with the elements inside it.
It took me around an hour to figure out how to add my text inside my card.
